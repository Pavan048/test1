# SECTION 4 — CONTENT RULES

**Forbidden Phrasing (Product vibes):**
- "Start Building" (Implies DIY)
- "Sign Up"
- "The Platform/Engine" (Unless referring to our internal capability)
- "Use Cases" (Can feel too SaaS-like, prefer "What We Deliver")

**Required Phrasing (Agency vibes):**
- "Partner," "Client," "Project," "Delivery," "Consultation."
